# Know Your Tools - IDE

This project contains supporting documents for a "Know your Tools" workshop, focused on the IDE. 

The idea of the workshop came from the principle that good crafters know their tools well. I noticed I wasn't making 
good use of the various features and shortcuts of my IDE and thought investing the time to learn them would be
beneficial.

## Exercises

The various exercices are here to help you discover features of your existing IDE, or might be useful if you want to
switch to a new one to start exploring. There are some some exercises covering basic text editing, some based around
refactoring, etc .
You are encouraged to follow a "both hands on keyboard" rule to go further and forgo the mouse/trackpad entirely to
start building muscle memory for those time saving shortcuts....

Each exercise is described in the corresponding .md file. They follow a loose logical order, but there is no dependency
between them, so you can pick & choose. The general format is:
* Do XYZ - no constraints
* Find a quicker way (explore menus / identify shortcuts / ask around...)
* Practice new way several times

The suggested refactoring is based on the code from "legacy code retreat", which you can find here: 
https://github.com/jbrains/trivia .
It covers a variety of languages. I recommend picking one which you're already familiar
with. However, if there's another codebase you're familiar with, there are probably relevant examples too!

## Prep

Ingredients needed on your machine before you start going into the exercises:
* IDE / Text Editor of choice
* "legacy code retreat" project for your chosen language
* a local version control will help (we'll be doing some change, reset, repeat cycles)
